# These are my dotfiles
* It's mostly themes and icons for my current pop_os gnome setup...
* Other things include my neovim config (it's just kickstarter.nvim with a gruvgox theme lol), my zsh, zellij and Alacritty config
* Also includes a script that makes symlinks to the default paths for everything (Not zellij... I will update that later)
    * In order for the script to work the repo has to be copied to ~/.dotfiles... Meaning just do git clone to ~.
* Prolly wont update often rn
